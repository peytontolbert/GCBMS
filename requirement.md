We are developing a Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS) that integrates a graph database with a web-based UI and an LLM agent. This system enables users to interact with and manage codebases through a chat interface by representing code as interconnected nodes and edges within a graph. Users can upload existing codebases or start new projects, all managed and modified in a graph structure that reflects the code's architecture and functionality. The LLM agent can autonomously or interactively perform codebase engineering tasks, including refactoring, generating new code, and modifying the system’s own graph-based representation.

Project Goals:

Graph-Based Codebase Representation:
Represent entire codebases, including files, functions, classes, and their dependencies, as nodes and edges within a graph database.
Support user uploads of existing codebases or the creation of new projects directly in the graph.
Web UI with LLM Agent Integration:
Develop a web-based UI allowing users to chat with an LLM agent, visualize the graph-based codebase, and manage projects interactively.
Codebase Engineering:
Enable the LLM agent to modify codebases within the graph, supporting actions like code refactoring, dependency management, and code generation.
Allow the agent to dynamically understand and modify its own codebase using the graph representation.
Self-Referential Graph Architecture:
Represent the application itself in the graph database, enabling the agent to operate on its own codebase, extending its capabilities autonomously.
Project Management:
Provide functionalities for creating, importing, and managing multiple codebases within the system.
Facilitate versioning and tracking changes within the graph structure.

Key Features:

Graph Database Integration:

Store codebases as graph structures, where nodes represent files, functions, classes, variables, and documentation.
Define edges as dependencies, function calls, inheritance, and file inclusions.
Support dynamic updates to the graph as the codebase evolves, maintaining an up-to-date model of the entire system.
LLM Agent Capabilities:

Understand and navigate the graph-based representation of codebases.
Perform code generation, refactoring, and querying within the graph.
Modify its own graph representation, enabling self-improvement and adaptation.
Interact with users via the web UI to take instructions, generate new code, and perform automated tasks.
Web UI and User Interaction:

A user-friendly interface to upload existing codebases or start new projects.
Visualization of the graph structure, showing files, functions, and dependencies.
Chat interface to interact with the LLM agent for querying or instructing modifications.
Project and Codebase Management:

Import and parse existing codebases, converting them into graph representations.
Create new projects within the UI, where the LLM agent assists in scaffolding the initial code structure.
Manage multiple projects, providing a high-level view of all codebases and their interdependencies.
Graph-Based Operations:

Enable the LLM agent to query the graph database for code relationships, usage, and optimization opportunities.
Facilitate complex refactoring operations by understanding and modifying dependencies across the graph.
Provide mechanisms for code validation and testing based on the graph structure.
Self-Referential Architecture:

The system itself, including its UI, agent logic, and database interactions, is modeled within the graph.
The LLM agent can utilize this representation to adapt and optimize its own functionality.
Documentation Requirements:

Prompt for LLM:
"Using the detailed information provided, generate comprehensive documentation for the Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS). The documentation should cover the entire system, including architecture, user interaction, agent capabilities, and graph operations. Ensure the documentation is well-organized, accessible, and provides clear instructions for both technical and non-technical users. Include diagrams and examples where applicable to illustrate complex concepts. Highlight the unique aspects of the graph-based approach, such as the ability to dynamically manage and modify multiple codebases, including the system’s own codebase, through a self-referential graph structure."
