Exhaustive Use-Cases for Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS)
1. Codebase Interaction through Chat Interface:
Ask for General Information:

User asks: “What are the main components of this codebase?”
Agent responds with a high-level overview of the codebase, listing key files, classes, and their purpose.
Query Functionality:

User asks: “What does the generate_embeddings function do?”
Agent provides a detailed explanation of the function, including its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any dependencies.
Dependency Analysis:

User asks: “Which functions depend on load_skill_description?”
Agent queries the graph and returns a list of functions or files that use this function, along with a visual representation.
Code Refactoring Request:

User asks: “Can you refactor the process_data function to improve performance?”
Agent analyzes the function, suggests or makes modifications, and updates the graph with the changes.
Exploring Code Changes:

User asks: “What changes were made in the last update?”
Agent provides a summary of recent changes, including files and functions modified, and visualizes them in the graph.
Get Code Snippets:

User asks: “Show me the implementation of the save_file_graph function.”
Agent retrieves and displays the code snippet for the requested function.
Generate Documentation:

User asks: “Generate documentation for the find_similar_files function.”
Agent generates and presents a detailed documentation, including function signature, description, usage examples, and dependencies.
Identify and Fix Bugs:

User asks: “There’s a bug in the load_messages function. Can you identify and fix it?”
Agent analyzes the function, identifies potential issues, and either suggests fixes or implements them directly in the graph.
Add New Feature:

User asks: “Can you add a new function to export the graph as a JSON file?”
Agent creates a new function, integrates it into the codebase, and updates the graph with the new node and connections.
2. Codebase Interaction through Visual Graph UI:
Explore Codebase Graph:

User navigates through the visual graph interface to explore the codebase structure, viewing connections between files, functions, and classes.
Visualize Function Dependencies:

User clicks on a function node to view all functions or files that depend on it, visualized as connected nodes and edges.
View Detailed Node Information:

User clicks on a node (e.g., a function) to view detailed information, including code snippet, documentation, and connected dependencies.
Highlight and Filter Nodes:

User applies filters to highlight specific nodes, such as functions with the most dependencies or files that have been recently modified.
Track Code Changes:

User views a timeline or history of changes in the graph, showing which nodes have been added, modified, or removed over time.
Compare Codebase Versions:

User selects two versions of the codebase to compare, with the graph highlighting differences in nodes and edges.
Visual Refactoring:

User selects a function or file and asks the system to visually refactor it, showing before and after representations in the graph.
Create New Project Graph:

User initiates a new project from the UI, with the graph starting as an empty structure, and the agent assists in scaffolding initial files and functions.
Integrate New Codebase:

User uploads an existing codebase, and the system parses it into the graph, creating nodes and edges to represent its structure.
Interact with Self-Referential Graph:

User views the system’s own codebase in the graph and can make changes that affect the application’s behavior, such as modifying the agent’s response logic.
3. Codebase Management and Project Operations:
Create New Project:

User starts a new project, defining its structure in the graph and using the agent to scaffold initial components like files, classes, and documentation.
Upload Existing Codebase:

User uploads a zip file or repository URL, and the system parses the codebase into the graph, creating nodes for each file, function, and dependency.
Version Control Integration:

User integrates with a Git repository, enabling version control within the graph structure. The graph updates with each commit, reflecting changes.
Track and Manage Dependencies:

User views and manages external dependencies (e.g., libraries) through the graph, visualizing which parts of the codebase rely on them.
Generate and Run Tests:

User asks the agent to generate unit tests for specific functions, which are added as nodes to the graph and can be executed directly from the UI.
Automated Code Review:

User requests an automated code review, where the agent analyzes the graph for potential issues, such as unused functions, circular dependencies, or code smells.
Graph-Based Code Analysis:

User initiates an analysis of the codebase’s architecture, where the agent evaluates the graph for complexity, coupling, and cohesion metrics.
Codebase Documentation:

User asks the agent to generate or update the documentation for the entire codebase, which is represented in the graph with nodes linked to relevant functions and files.
Dynamic Code Refactoring:

User requests dynamic refactoring of specific parts of the codebase, with the agent suggesting changes and updating the graph accordingly.
System Optimization:

User asks the agent to optimize the system's own codebase (self-referential graph), improving its performance or adding new capabilities dynamically.
4. Advanced Interactions and Customization:
Custom Graph Queries:

User enters custom queries to explore the graph, such as “Show all functions not tested” or “Find all nodes with circular dependencies.”
Interactive Learning Mode:

User switches to an interactive learning mode where the agent explains graph concepts, dependencies, and code structures interactively.
Integration with External Tools:

User integrates with external tools, such as CI/CD pipelines or monitoring services, visualizing their status and impact on the codebase in the graph.
AI Model Integration:

User uploads or modifies an AI model directly in the graph, with the agent assisting in connecting it to relevant parts of the codebase.
Security Analysis:

User asks the agent to perform a security analysis of the codebase, identifying vulnerabilities and representing them as warning nodes in the graph.
Performance Profiling:

User requests a performance profile of the codebase, visualizing hotspots or performance bottlenecks as highlighted nodes in the graph.
Feedback Loop and Improvement:

User provides feedback on the agent’s performance or code suggestions, and the agent adapts its behavior by modifying its own graph representation.
Custom Plugin Development:

User develops custom plugins or extensions, represented as nodes in the graph, which the agent can use to extend its capabilities.
5. System Self-Modification:
Agent Self-Optimization:

Agent periodically analyzes its own graph representation for optimization opportunities, refactoring its logic or adding new capabilities.
Auto-Update System:

Agent updates the system’s own codebase (e.g., adding new functionalities or fixing issues) based on user feedback and self-analysis.
Dynamic Capability Expansion:

Agent adds new skills or abilities by modifying its own graph, integrating new APIs or knowledge sources dynamically.
Autonomous System Expansion:

Agent autonomously creates new modules or expands its graph representation based on user-defined goals or tasks.
These use-cases comprehensively cover the potential interactions between users, the LLM agent, and the graph-based system. They also demonstrate how the system can manage, modify, and create codebases while providing users with powerful visualization and interaction capabilities.
