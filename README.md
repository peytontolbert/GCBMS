# Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS)

## Overview

The Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS) is an innovative platform that reimagines codebase management by representing code as interconnected nodes and edges within a graph structure. By integrating a powerful graph database with a web-based user interface (UI) and a sophisticated Language Learning Model (LLM) agent, GBCMS provides a dynamic, interactive environment for code management, modification, and generation.

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Code Representation**: Visualize and manage codebases as graphs, enhancing understanding of complex architectures.
- **LLM Agent Integration**: Utilize an AI agent for code generation, refactoring, querying, and codebase modification upon user request.
- **Web-Based UI**: Interact with your codebase through an intuitive interface featuring graph visualization, codebase editing, and a chat-based agent.
- **Self-Referential Architecture**: The system represents its own codebase within the graph database, allowing for introspection and modification when instructed.
- **Project Management**: Create, import, and manage multiple codebases within the system.
- **Execution Engine**: Run projects that are uploaded to the database.

## System Architecture

GBCMS consists of several key components:

1. **Graph Database Module**: Stores and manages the codebase as a graph.
2. **LLM Agent Module**: Interacts with both the user and the graph database to perform code-related tasks.
3. **Web User Interface (UI) Module**: Provides tools for project management, graph visualization, code editing, and agent interaction.
4. **Code Parser Module**: Parses existing codebases into the graph representation.
5. **Project Management Module**: Handles project lifecycle and version control integration.
6. **API Layer Module**: Facilitates communication between modules and external services.
7. **Authentication and Authorization Module**: Manages user access and permissions.
8. **Logging and Monitoring Module**: Tracks system activities and performance.
9. **Configuration Management Module**: Handles system and module-specific settings.
10. **Execution Engine Module**: Allows running of projects uploaded to the database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Neo4j 4.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gbcms.git
   cd gbcms
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary configurations (database URLs, API keys, etc.).

5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

7. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

8. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`
