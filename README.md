Introduction
Welcome to the Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS). This cutting-edge platform reimagines codebase management by representing code as interconnected nodes and edges within a graph structure. By integrating a powerful graph database with a web-based user interface (UI) and a sophisticated Language Learning Model (LLM) agent, GBCMS provides a dynamic, interactive environment for code management, modification, and generation.

Key Features:

Graph-Based Code Representation: Visualize and manage codebases as graphs, enhancing understanding of complex architectures.
LLM Agent Integration: Utilize an AI agent for code generation, refactoring, querying, and self-improvement tasks.
Web-Based UI: Interact with your codebase through an intuitive interface featuring graph visualization and a chat-based agent.
Self-Referential Architecture: Allow the system to represent and modify its own codebase, enabling continuous optimization.
System Architecture
Graph Database
The core of GBCMS is a robust graph database that models codebases as interconnected graphs.

Nodes: Represent code elements such as files, classes, functions, variables, and documentation.
Edges: Define relationships including dependencies, function calls, inheritance, and associations.
Dynamic Updates: The graph automatically updates to reflect changes in the codebase, ensuring an up-to-date model.
LLM Agent
The LLM agent is a central component that interacts with both the user and the graph database.

Capabilities: Performs code generation, refactoring, querying, and can modify its own codebase.
Interaction: Engages with users via the chat interface and operates autonomously on the graph.
Web User Interface (UI)
The web-based UI provides a user-friendly platform for interacting with GBCMS.

Features: Project management tools, graph visualization, and a chat interface for agent interaction.
Accessibility: Designed for both technical and non-technical users with intuitive navigation and controls.
Self-Referential Graph Structure
GBCMS models its own codebase within the graph database, allowing the LLM agent to:

Modify Its Own Code: Enabling self-improvement and adaptation.
Optimize Performance: Adjust functionalities based on usage patterns and feedback.

(Insert a diagram illustrating the interaction between the user, web UI, LLM agent, and graph database.)

Graph Schema
Node Types
File: Source code files.
Class: Object-oriented classes.
Function: Functions or methods.
Variable: Global or local variables.
Module/Package: Collections of files or libraries.
Documentation: Comments, docstrings, or external documentation.
Edge Types
Dependency: One node depends on another (e.g., file imports a module).
Function Call: A function invokes another function.
Inheritance: Class inheritance relationships.
Association: General relationships between nodes.
Documentation Link: Connects code elements to their documentation.
Example Configurations
Function Call Example:
