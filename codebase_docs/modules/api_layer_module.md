## Overview
The API Layer Module serves as the intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend services of the Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS). It provides a standardized interface for external and internal modules to interact with the system's core functionalities. This module is responsible for handling HTTP requests, managing WebSocket connections for real-time communication, and ensuring secure and efficient data exchange.

## Module Structure
The API Layer Module is composed of three primary components:
1. **RESTful API Endpoints**
2. **WebSocket Services**
3. **API Gateway**

Each component is designed to handle specific aspects of API management, promoting a modular and maintainable architecture.

## Responsibilities
- **Inter-Module Communication**: Facilitate seamless interactions between different modules within GBCMS through standardized APIs.
- **External Access**: Expose APIs for external tools, services, and clients to interact with GBCMS functionalities.
- **Security**: Ensure secure communication channels and enforce authentication and authorization protocols for all API interactions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching, load balancing, and efficient query handling to optimize API performance.
- **Scalability**: Design APIs to handle increasing loads and scale horizontally as demand grows.

## Components

### RESTful API Endpoints
**Description:**

## Implementation Details

### Interaction Flow
1. **Incoming Request**: A client sends an HTTP request to the API Layer.
2. **Authentication**: The API Gateway verifies the JWT token for authentication.
3. **Authorization**: The system checks if the user has the necessary permissions for the requested action.
4. **Routing**: The API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate RESTful endpoint or WebSocket service.
5. **Processing**: The backend service processes the request, interacts with the database or other modules as needed.
6. **Response**: The API Layer sends back a response to the client, ensuring it adheres to the API specifications.

### Error Handling
- **Standardized Error Responses**: All errors follow a consistent format with error codes and descriptive messages.
- **Exception Management**: Utilize try-catch blocks to handle unforeseen issues gracefully.
- **Logging**: All errors are logged with relevant details for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Logging
- **Request Logging**: Logs every incoming API request with details like endpoint accessed, request parameters, and user identification.
- **Error Logging**: Captures and logs all errors and exceptions thrown during API processing.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks response times and payload sizes to monitor API performance.

## Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: All incoming data is validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the number of requests per user to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **CORS Policies**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict resource access to trusted domains.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Performance & Scalability
- **Caching**: Implements caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple server instances to ensure high availability and reliability.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Supports adding more server instances to handle increased load without significant changes to the architecture.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes async operations to handle I/O-bound tasks efficiently, improving overall responsiveness.

## Extensibility
- **Modular Design**: The API Layer is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of new endpoints and services.
- **Plugin Support**: Supports plugins or extensions to introduce new functionalities without altering the core system.
- **Versioning**: Implements API versioning to manage updates and maintain backward compatibility.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Integrating External Tools
**Scenario:**
An external Continuous Integration (CI) tool needs to interact with GBCMS to trigger builds and fetch project statuses.

**Steps:**
1. The CI tool authenticates using its JWT token.
2. It sends a `POST /api/projects` request to create a new project.
3. Upon successful creation, it receives the `project_id` and proceeds with build operations.

### 2. Real-Time Notifications
**Scenario:**
A frontend application requires real-time updates on project changes to reflect them instantly in the UI.

**Steps:**
1. The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection with the API Layer.
2. When changes occur in a project, the API Layer broadcasts updates through the WebSocket.
3. The frontend receives the update and refreshes the relevant UI components accordingly.

### 3. Automated Reporting
**Scenario:**
A reporting service fetches project data periodically to generate performance reports.

**Steps:**
1. The reporting service authenticates with the API Layer using a service account.
2. It sends a `GET /api/projects/{project_id}` request to retrieve project details.
3. Processes the received data to generate comprehensive performance reports.

## Glossary
- **API Gateway**: A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester.
