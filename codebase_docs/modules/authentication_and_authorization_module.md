## Overview
The Authentication and Authorization Module is responsible for managing user identities, roles, and permissions within the Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS). It ensures secure access to resources by authenticating users and authorizing their actions based on predefined roles and permissions. This module integrates with other components of GBCMS to enforce security policies and protect sensitive data.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **User Management**: Handle user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Authentication**: Verify user identities using secure methods.
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **Session Management**: Maintain secure user sessions with token-based authentication.
- **Security Enforcement**: Implement best practices to safeguard against common security threats.

## Module Structure
The Authentication and Authorization Module is composed of three primary components:
1. **Auth Server**
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
3. **Encryption Services**

Each component is designed to handle specific aspects of authentication and authorization, promoting a secure and maintainable architecture.

## Responsibilities
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts, including registration, login, and profile updates.
- **Authentication**: Authenticate users using secure token-based methods.
- **Authorization**: Assign roles and permissions to users and enforce access controls.
- **Session Management**: Handle user sessions securely, including token issuance and renewal.
- **Security Enforcement**: Protect against security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS attacks.

## API Specifications

### Authentication
- **Method**: Token-based authentication using JWT.
- **Flow**:
  1. User registers or logs in with credentials.
  2. Server issues an access token and a refresh token.
  3. Access token is used for authenticated requests.
  4. Refresh token is used to obtain new access tokens upon expiration.

### Authorization
- **Method**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Flow**:
  1. User is assigned one or more roles.
  2. Each role has defined permissions.
  3. Permissions determine access to resources and actions.

## Implementation Details

### Workflow
1. **Registration**:
   - User submits registration details.
   - `AuthController.register_user` validates and creates a new user.
   - Password is hashed using `EncryptionService.hash_password`.
   - User roles are assigned based on default or provided values.

2. **Login**:
   - User submits login credentials.
   - `AuthController.authenticate_user` verifies credentials.
   - Upon success, JWT access and refresh tokens are generated and returned.

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - User submits a valid refresh token.
   - `AuthController.refresh_token` verifies the refresh token and issues a new access token.

4. **Authorization**:
   - Incoming requests are authenticated using the access token.
   - `RBACManager.check_permission` verifies if the user has the necessary permissions for the requested action.

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Returned when input data fails validation checks.
- **Authentication Errors**: Returned when credentials are invalid or tokens are expired.
- **Authorization Errors**: Returned when users lack necessary permissions.
- **Server Errors**: Returned for unexpected server-side issues.
- **Standardized Error Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "error_code": "string",
    "message": "string"
  }
  ```

### Logging
- **Authentication Logs**: Record all login attempts, successes, and failures.
- **Authorization Logs**: Record access attempts to protected resources.
- **Error Logs**: Capture detailed information about errors and exceptions.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain records of critical operations for compliance and auditing purposes.

## Security Considerations
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using strong algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens are signed securely and stored appropriately on the client side.
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications occur over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Account Lockout**: Lock user accounts after a defined number of failed login attempts.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations.
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitize outputs to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Performance & Scalability
- **Efficient Token Verification**: Optimize JWT verification to reduce latency.
- **Database Optimization**: Index user and role tables to speed up queries.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data like user roles and permissions using Redis or similar technologies.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the module to scale horizontally by adding more instances behind a load balancer.
- **Stateless Design**: Ensure the auth server is stateless to facilitate easy scaling and load balancing.

## Extensibility
- **Modular Architecture**: Components are loosely coupled, allowing for easy integration of new authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, SAML).
- **Plugin Support**: Enable plugins to introduce additional authentication providers or authorization mechanisms.
- **Configurable Roles and Permissions**: Allow dynamic creation and modification of roles and permissions without code changes.
- **API Versioning**: Implement versioning for authentication APIs to manage updates and maintain backward compatibility.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. User Registration and Login
**Scenario:**
A new user wants to create an account and access GBCMS features.

**Steps:**
1. User submits registration details via the frontend.
2. `AuthController.register_user` validates and creates the user.
3. User receives confirmation and can proceed to log in.
4. User submits login credentials.
5. `AuthController.authenticate_user` verifies credentials and issues tokens.
6. User accesses protected resources using the access token.

### 2. Role Assignment and Permission Enforcement
**Scenario:**
An admin assigns the "Developer" role to a user, granting them write access to certain projects.

**Steps:**
1. Admin accesses the role management interface.
2. Admin selects a user and assigns the "Developer" role via `RBACManager.assign_role`.
3. User now has permissions associated with the "Developer" role.
4. When the user attempts to perform actions, `RBACManager.check_permission` verifies their permissions before allowing the action.

### 3. Token Refresh Workflow
**Scenario:**
A user's access token has expired, and they need to obtain a new one without re-authenticating.

**Steps:**
1. User's frontend detects the expired access token.
2. Frontend sends a `POST /api/auth/refresh` request with the refresh token.
3. `AuthController.refresh_token` validates the refresh token and issues a new access token.
4. User continues to access resources with the new access token.

  - *Example*: Verify that `encrypt_password` correctly hashes and verifies passwords.
  
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test the interaction between authentication endpoints and the database.
  - *Example*: Ensure that a registered user can log in and receive valid tokens.
  
- **Security Tests**:
  - Test for vulnerabilities like SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS.
  - *Example*: Attempt SQL injection on the registration endpoint to ensure it is handled safely.
  
- **Performance Tests**:
  - Assess the module's responsiveness under high load.
  - *Example*: Simulate multiple concurrent login requests to evaluate performance and scalability.
  
- **Continuous Integration**:
  - Set up CI pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on each commit.
  - Ensure that new changes do not introduce regressions or security vulnerabilities.
