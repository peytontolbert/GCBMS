- **Log Viewer**: Interface for accessing and filtering system and agent logs.
- **Project Manager**: Tools for creating new projects, importing existing ones, and managing project-specific settings.
- **User Settings**: Options for customizing user preferences, themes, and configurations.

**Technologies Used:**
- **React.js**: For building reusable UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Adds type safety and improves code maintainability.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux for predictable state management across the application.
- **Routing**: Managed with React Router for seamless navigation between pages.

### Graph Renderer

## Implementation Details

### Interaction Flow
1. **User Navigation**: User selects a project from the dashboard.
2. **Data Retrieval**: Frontend requests project data via `GET /api/projects/{project_id}`.
3. **Graph Rendering**: The codebase graph is visualized using the Graph Renderer.
4. **Code Editing**: User selects a file/node, triggering the Code Editor to display its content.
5. **Saving Changes**: Upon editing, the user saves changes, which are sent to `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/files/{file_id}/save`.
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Changes are reflected in the graph and other relevant UI components.
7. **Chat Interaction**: User communicates with the LLM Agent through the Chat Interface, sending prompts and receiving responses.

### Error Handling
- **API Errors**: Display user-friendly error messages when API requests fail.
- **Validation Errors**: Inform users about incorrect input formats or missing required fields.
- **Network Issues**: Notify users of connectivity problems and provide options to retry.
- **Logging**: All errors are logged in the `LogEntry` entity for auditing and debugging purposes.

### Logging
- **User Actions**: Every significant user action (e.g., saving a file, creating a project) is recorded.
- **System Events**: System-level events and errors are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Access Logs**: Track user access patterns to identify potential security issues.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication Enforcement**: Ensure all endpoints require valid JWT tokens.
- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent injection attacks by sanitizing all user inputs.
- **Access Control**: Restrict actions based on user roles to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and abuse.
- **Session Management**: Securely manage user sessions to prevent hijacking and fixation.

## Performance & Scalability
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimize the Graph Renderer for large codebases to maintain UI responsiveness.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components and data on-demand to reduce initial load times.
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Utilize caching for frequently accessed data to minimize API calls.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to handle high user concurrency.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the frontend to support scaling by adding more instances as needed.

## Extensibility
- **Modular Architecture**: Design components to be easily replaceable or extendable without affecting the entire system.
- **Plugin Support**: Allow for the addition of plugins to introduce new features or integrations.
- **API Flexibility**: Ensure APIs are versioned and backward-compatible to accommodate future enhancements.
- **Theming and Customization**: Provide options for customizing the UI theme and layout to suit different user preferences.

## Example Use Cases

**Scenario:**
A user wants to create a new project within GBCMS.

**Steps:**
1. User navigates to the Project Manager in the UI.
2. Clicks on "Create New Project" and fills in project details.
3. Frontend sends a request to `POST /api/projects` with the project information.
4. Backend creates the project and returns confirmation.
5. The new project appears in the Dashboard and is ready for codebase import.

### 2. Editing a Code File
**Scenario:**
A developer needs to update a function within a code file.

**Steps:**
1. User selects the desired file from the Graph Viewer.
2. Code Editor loads the current content of the file.
3. User makes the necessary changes and clicks "Save."
4. Frontend sends the updated content to `POST /api/projects/{project_id}/files/{file_id}/save`.
5. Backend saves the changes, updates the graph, and returns a success message.
6. The UI reflects the updated code and graph structure.

### 3. Communicating with the LLM Agent
**Scenario:**
A user seeks assistance in generating boilerplate code for a new feature.

**Steps:**
1. User opens the Chat Interface and types a prompt: "Generate boilerplate code for a user authentication feature."
2. Frontend sends the prompt to the backend via WebSocket or relevant API.
3. Backend processes the request through the LLM Agent Module.
4. Generated code snippets are returned and displayed in the Chat Interface.
5. User can directly insert the generated code into the Code Editor.

  3. **Graph Population:** Identified elements are converted into nodes and edges and uploaded to the Graph Database.
  4. **Visualization:** The imported project is visualized in the Graph Viewer with appropriate color-coded nodes and edges.

**Benefits:**
- **Efficiency:** Streamlines the process of integrating existing projects into GBCMS.
- **Accuracy:** Ensures that all relevant connections and dependencies are accurately represented in the graph.
- **User Experience:** Provides a seamless transition for users bringing their codebases into the system.

**Configuration Options:**
