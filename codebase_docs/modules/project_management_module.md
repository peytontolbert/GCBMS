## Overview
The Project Management Module is responsible for handling the lifecycle of projects within the Graph-Based Codebase Management System (GBCMS). It manages project creation, deletion, configuration, version control integration, and execution of projects. This module ensures seamless management of multiple projects, maintaining data integrity and security throughout the process.

### Key Responsibilities:
- **Project Lifecycle Management**: Creation, deletion, and configuration of projects.
- **Version Control Integration**: Interface with Git or other version control systems for code versioning.
- **Multi-Project Support**: Handle multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Execution of Projects**: Allow for running projects that are uploaded to the database.

## Module Structure
The Project Management Module is organized into the following key components:
1. **Project Manager**
2. **VCS Integrator**
3. **Settings and Preferences**
4. **Execution Engine Interface**

## Components

### Project Manager
**Description:**

Handles the core logic for managing project states, including creation, deletion, retrieval, and listing of projects.

**Classes and Methods:**
- `ProjectManager`
  - `create_project(project_info)`: Creates a new project with the provided information.
  - `delete_project(project_id)`: Deletes the specified project.
  - `get_project(project_id)`: Retrieves details of a specific project.
  - `list_projects(user_id)`: Lists all projects associated with a user.

**Technologies Used:**

## Implementation Details

### Interaction Flow
1. **Project Creation**:
   - User submits a request to create a new project via the UI.
   - Frontend sends a `POST /api/projects` request with project details.
   - Backend processes the request, creates the project in the database, and returns the project data.
2. **Version Control Operations**:
   - User links a repository during project setup.
   - VCS Integrator clones the repository using provided URL and branch.
3. **Project Execution**:
   - User initiates project execution through the UI.
   - Execution Interface sends a request to the Execution Engine to start the project.
   - Execution status is monitored and displayed in the UI.

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Returns 400 Bad Request with error details if input data is invalid.
- **Authentication Errors**: Returns 401 Unauthorized if the user is not authenticated.
- **Authorization Errors**: Returns 403 Forbidden if the user lacks permissions.
- **Server Errors**: Returns 500 Internal Server Error for unexpected issues.

### Logging
- **Action Logs**: Records actions like project creation, deletion, and execution.
- **Error Logs**: Captures details of any errors encountered during operations.
- **Access Logs**: Tracks user access patterns and API usage.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: Ensures all API endpoints are secured with JWT tokens.
- **Authorization**: Implements role-based access control to restrict actions based on user roles.
- **Input Sanitization**: Validates and sanitizes all input data to prevent injection attacks.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data both in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **Rate Limiting**: Applies rate limiting on API endpoints to mitigate brute-force attacks.

## Performance & Scalability
- **Efficient Database Queries**: Optimizes queries to handle large numbers of projects and users.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses asynchronous tasks for time-consuming operations like repository cloning.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Designs the module to scale horizontally with increased load.
- **Caching**: Implements caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

## Extensibility
- **Plugin Architecture**: Allows integration of additional version control systems beyond Git.
- **Modular Design**: Facilitates easy addition of new features without impacting existing functionality.
- **API Versioning**: Supports API versioning to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.
