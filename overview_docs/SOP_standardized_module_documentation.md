### Integrated Example: Adding a New Class and Establishing Dependencies

**Scenario:**
A developer adds a new class to the codebase and establishes dependencies with existing classes.

**Steps Involved:**

1. **Add New Class via Web UI:**
   - **Action:** User clicks on "Add Class" in the Web UI.
   - **Module Interaction:**
     - **Web User Interface Module:** Captures the input and sends a request to the API Layer Module.
     - **API Layer Module:** Forwards the request to the Graph Database Module.

2. **Graph Database Module:**
   - **Action:** `NodeManager.create_node("Class", {"name": "PaymentService", "content": "class PaymentService { ... }"})`
   - **Result:** Creates a new Class node in Neo4j.

3. **Establish Dependencies:**
   - **Action:** User specifies that `PaymentService` depends on `UserService`.
   - **Module Interaction:**
     - **Web UI Module:** Sends dependency information to the API Layer.
     - **API Layer Module:** Instructs the Graph Database Module to create a Dependency edge.

4. **Graph Database Module:**
   - **Action:** `EdgeManager.create_edge(source_node_id="PaymentService_id", target_node_id="UserService_id", "Dependency", {"version": "1.0"})`
   - **Result:** Establishes a Dependency edge between `PaymentService` and `UserService`.

5. **Visualization:**

     - **Graph Database Module:** Provides the latest nodes and edges data.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
# Adding a new class node
payment_service = node_manager.create_node(
    node_type="Class",
    attributes={
        "name": "PaymentService",
        "content": "class PaymentService { ... }",
        "timestamp": "2024-09-19T10:00:00Z"
    }
)

# Creating a dependency edge
dependency_edge = edge_manager.create_edge(
    source_node_id=payment_service['id'],
    target_node_id="UserService_id",
    edge_type="Dependency",
    attributes={"version": "1.0", "timestamp": "2024-09-19T10:05:00Z"}

Log Management: Explain how logs are stored, accessed, and rotated.
Example:

markdown
Copy code
### Error Handling in Graph Database Module

#### Strategies

- **Graceful Degradation:** If the database connection fails, the module retries the connection before failing gracefully.
- **Exception Handling:** Wrap critical operations in try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
- **User-Friendly Messages:** Return clear and actionable error messages to the API consumers.

#### Logging Mechanisms

- **Logging Levels:**
  - **INFO:** General operational messages.
  - **WARNING:** Indications of potential issues.
  - **ERROR:** Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
  - **CRITICAL:** Severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.

- **Log Management:**
  - **Storage:** Logs are stored in a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack).
  - **Rotation:** Implement log rotation to manage disk space and archive old logs.
  - **Access:** Only authorized personnel can access and view logs.

#### Example Error Handling Code

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_node(node_type, attributes):
    try:
        # Attempt to create node
        node = graph_db.create_node(node_type, attributes)
        logger.info(f"Node created with ID: {node['id']}")
        return node
    except DatabaseConnectionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database connection failed: {e}")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error while creating node: {e}")
        raise
